# Synapse Project

## Overview
Synapse is a machine learning framework designed to facilitate the development and deployment of neural network models. This project provides a structured approach to building, training, and evaluating models, along with utilities for data handling and API integration.

```

## Installation
To set up the Synapse environment, run the appropriate setup script for your operating system:

- For Windows:
  ```
  scripts/setup.bat
  ```

- For Unix/Linux:
  ```
  scripts/setup.sh
  ```

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage
1. **Load Data**: Use the data loading utilities in `src/data/loader.py` to load your datasets.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Utilize functions in `src/data/preprocessor.py` for data cleaning and feature extraction.
3. **Build Models**: Define and train your neural network models using classes and methods in `src/models/neural_network.py`.
4. **API Integration**: Access your models via the API endpoints defined in `src/api/endpoints.py`.

## Testing
Unit tests are provided in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, use the following command:
```
pytest tests/
```
